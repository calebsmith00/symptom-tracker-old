# Introduction

Hello, thank you for taking the time to look at my symptom tracker web application. This application was created to support my wife, who has type 1 diabetes. Diabeties can cause a plethora of medical side effects, and as such, it's important for her to track her symptoms. Right now, she is using good 'ole pen and paper, but I aim to create this to make it easier for her.

## Usage

Currently, the only way to access this is by cloning the repository and building the development server yourself. I will provide instructions below, but I aim to get this app published at my domain, [developercaleb.com](https://developercaleb.com).

## Installation

1. First, [clone the repository](https://github.com/minifiedcode/symptom-tracker.git).
2. Next, use your preferred terminal to navigate to wherever you cloned the repository.
3. Then, in the terminal, type `npm install` to install the required modules.
4. Finally, in the terminal, type `npm start` to run the development server.

## TODO: repository

While this repository contains a undisclosed Trello board, I intend on updating changes I need to make to the repository in here.

1. Update README.md, when the time comes, to include instructions on accessing the API.
2. Update README.md to include the format of required environment variables.
